# Temtem Overlay by Antize (Updated)

## Last Version
**Antize Temtem (Ver.1.13)** 

Uses data from the official wiki so you don't have to update the overlay every time the game is updated.

**The overlay :**
- **Doesn't** read Temtem memory
- **Doesn't** intercept any Client-Server communication
- **Doesn't** automate any part of gameplay
- **Doesn't** do anything a player couldn't do themselves using Alt+Tab -> https://temtem.gamepedia.com/Temtem_Wiki

**Keep in memory**, this is not a cheat, it does nothing more than ALT+TAB and go to the wiki, it does not read memory or intercept network data!
